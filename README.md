this is a personal project to create a voice directed digital assistant based on the max headroom character.

written in python, using langchain, langgraph, etc.

it currently will respond as an LLM like usual, but can also control spotify

this is a fun work in progress. if you want to use it and or develop for it be my guest. would love to have more tools designed.

Note:

1) this will work with openai or ollama models. you will need to set up the .env for that as well as spotify
2) this is designed to pull a custom voice from the alltalk project https://github.com/erew123/alltalk_tts, that is how I am cloning max headroom's voice. You can alter or simply not use this, it will currently fallback to pyttsx3.

Will move more variables to the .env folders soon.
